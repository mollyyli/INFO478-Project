### INFO 478 Project Plan - Group 2



**Project Description**

What's the purpose of your project plan? 

The purpose of our project is to determine the effect on mental health of a career in the technology industry. 

What other research has been done in this area? Make sure to **include 3+ links** to related works, as well as a summary of what that work has discovered.

- https://public.tableau.com/profile/indre7434#!/vizhome/MentalHealthinTechSurvey_0/MentalHealthintheTechWorkplaceThis is a page of visualizations that were made based on the OSMI 2017 survey data collection. The survey aimed to raise awareness of mental health disorders of those who work in the tech field. Out of 756 responses, 43% of them are currently suffering from mental health issues with 29% being mood disorder and 26% anxiety disorder. Furthermore, it has been found that most people feel uncomfortable discussing mental health issues and nor will they bring this up to the employer, people are in great fear that the disorders will affect their job. What surprises the most is that only 1% responders think the tech field provides excellent support with mental health issues, where 85% think it’s average. It was very unfortunate to find that employers care more about physical health compared to mental health.

  This research sought to quantify the effect of the “always-on” workplace culture - that is the expectation that managers and senior-level employees are always just an email or text away. After surveying over 1,500 managers on the quality of their working life, the researchers concluded that, while 54% of those surveyed claimed to experience increased stress from these long work schedules and while a majority claim to find it hard to “switch off” from work, only 39% agree that their employer should restrict out-of-hours email access. Additionally, of those surveyed, 67% said that they are overall satisfied with their jobs. This is a surprise, to be sure.

- https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.htmlAs part of our examination of mental health in tech, we decided to look into, possibly, the most openly rigorous work environment in the industry - Amazon. Based on the article, Amazon certainly deserves their reputation for ruthlessness, carefully cultivating a culture that encourages workers to tear apart each other’s ideas, and stops for no one - even those suffering from serious health conditions. Former Amazon workers that were interviewed as part of the article recalled regularly watching coworkers sob at their desks, or being given low performance reviews (and later culled) due to absences caused by pregnancy, cancer, miscarriage, and a variety of other conditions, with managers saying that despite their reasons for being absent, “...the work is still going to need to get done.” While some manage to thrive, it’s obvious that a workplace like this would be difficult for the average employee to operate in and could factor into mental health conditions.

- https://thriveglobal.com/stories/are-we-tackling-mental-health-in-tech-companies-the-right-way/Working in tech companies is always stressful. It is constantly mentally exhausting, challenging and barely has any off days. With 1 in 4 having mental health problems, people in the tech field do not want to or are afraid of talking about mental health issues. Though slowly companies are realizing looking after employees also means taking care of their mental health, it is not enough. Tech companies should and need to improve workloads by the following: provide clear priority guidelines, don’t connect with employees 24/7, and lastly notice who’s seeking help and wanting to speak up. “We all have mental health. Work in the tech sector is stressful. If you don’t look after employees, another company will.” 

  

What is the dataset you'll be working with? Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be. You must find at **least two data sources** at this stage. 

- https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey (OSMI 2014)

- https://www.kaggle.com/osmihelp/osmi-mental-health-in-tech-survey-2019 (OSMI 2019)

  For our project, we will primarily be working with the OSMI 2014 and 2019 surveys. These were conducted by Open Sourcing Mental Illness, a non-profit that is dedicated to promoting mental wellness in the tech industry. We accessed these datasets from Kaggle, a well-known platform that provides free datasets, via the OSMI website (https://osmihelp.org/). 

  

Who is your **target audience**? 

Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences.People who are interested in working in tech industry People who are curious about how working in tech affects their mental health 



What should your audience learn from your resource? Please **consider specific questions** that your project can answer using the data you have identified (that are related to the overarching purpose)

- How is mental health affected by working remotely vs in an office space?

- How does self-employment affect mental health? 

- Of those with mental health conditions, how many are part of companies with a positive stance on mental health improvement?

- How do company attitudes towards mental health vary by size / location?

- How does mental health vary between men and women in a traditionally male-domaniated industry?

  

##### **Technical Description**

What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page, compiled .Rmd file, etc)?

.Rmd file 

Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?

We have two dataset that we want to work closely with but we are curious to know how mental health issues are being taken at big tech companies. Addtionally, there does not seem to be a ton of research in this area. The OSMI datasets were among the few quality datasets we found during our search.

What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?

- General formatting of Rmd doc
- Advanced plotting in R

What major challenges do you anticipate? 

Markdown format issues; We are not familiar with R as we took INFO201 a long time ago
